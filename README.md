Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

```bash
pnpm run build
```

## Thanks and credit

Thanks to [Daniel Tao for his `nearest-color` package](https://github.com/dtao/nearest-color) that has the algorithm to find the nearest colour.
